# PythonTicTacToe
TicTacToe made in Python, 1P or 2P available.

## Description 
A recreation of the original TicTacToe game. You can either play vs computer or you could play with another person (by taking turns).
Funny story: I accidentally made the 1 player mode unbeatable and I am too proud of it to fix it. You can try to beat it but good luck doing that I guess.

## Installation

1 - For Windows Users:
Run the file ```Game.exe```

2 - Others
Run in the terminal/command line ```pip install pygame``` and run the ```Game.py``` file
